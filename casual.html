								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Food to Fast Casual</h2>

								<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
                                    Why is fast casual food so popular today? How did it begin to replace fast food? And how has fast food responded?
                                </p>

								<p class="mb-4">In the 1990s, the very first fast casual dining restaurants opened for business (Carman, Tim). At this time, as previously mentioned, Americans began to become more health-conscious and looked for healthier alternatives. This is when brands like Subway began to take off, and fast food chains like McDonald’s had to change their menus and their advertisements. Yet, fast casuals didn’t catch on for another few years.</p>

								<p class="mb-4">In the early 2000s, fast casuals still weren’t as big as big chains like McDonald’s, but they were growing, and quickly. Data from 2002 showed that 4 of the top 10 fastest growing restaurant chains were all fast casuals: “Chipotle was first in growth, with an increase of 160% in sales and 70% unit growth last year; Baja Fresh was second… Panera was third… and Atlantic Bread was seventh,” (Tillotson, James E). This growth was happening while brands like McDonald’s were facing declines in earnings and were closing unprofitable restaurants (Tillotson, James E). Fast casual restaurants started to be preferred, as they seemed to offer everything the consumer wanted: food they could get fast, while it was good quality, fresh, a good value, and came with better service (Tillotson, James E).</p>

								<p class="mb-4">The growth of fast casuals continued: in 2009 they had sales of $19 billion, and in 2018, their sales were an impressive $47.5 billion (Carman, Tim). As smartphones became more popular, the ease of access of these fast casual restaurants increased. Instead of having to wait for a sit-down restaurant to get high-quality food, consumers could order food with a restaurant’s app, skip the line, and even get rewards for it (Carman, Tim). This, importantly, helped make fast food’s speed become irrelevant. Why go to McDonald’s for some fast food when you could get Chipotle just as quickly? And all these apps helped fast casual restaurants improve themselves. They could analyze consumer’s habits, where and when they ordered, how long it took them to get their food, and other important metrics that could help them design their stores and improve their service (Carman, Tim).</p>

								<p class="mb-4">Yet, fast food brands did not stand idly by. They continued to improve their menus, offering higher quality ingredients, and they invested in technology in order to keep up with the competition (Carman, Tim). This has led to an interesting situation where the differences between fast food and fast casual restaurants have become smaller, and they have heavily increased competition among themselves. This has made some of the most popular brands, like Chipotle, close some of their locations (Carman, Tim).</p>

								<p class="mb-4">And thus, we have been led to the current state of fast food. Healthier options have been introduced, restaurants have been rebranded, apps have made access easier than ever, but the lines between fast food, fast casual, and other restaurants have become less clear. One study from 2016 even found that entrees from fast casual restaurants have more calories than those from fast food restaurants (Schoffman, Danielle E., et al). Since this is the case, fast food seems to have no clear distinction between fast casual food. The only real difference seems to be in public perception. Fast food over the years has changed from a burgeoning new kind of food service that quickly gained popularity and grew internationally, to food that was viewed with skepticism for its negative health effects, to just another option in a massive food market where distinctions between kinds of food have become less clear.</p>
								
								<p class="mb-4">How will fast food continue to change in the future? Only time will tell.</p>
