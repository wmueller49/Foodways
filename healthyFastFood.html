								<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
                                    How did fast food brands market themselves after the changes in public perception of fast food? How did they make themselves more appealing? 
                                </p>

								<p class="mb-4">In order to gain the public’s approval once again, many fast food brands began to make little changes and push heavily with advertising. McDonald’s, as previously mentioned, created a “Eat Smart, Be Active” initiative, but they also made other changes, such as adding salads, fruits, and yogurt to their menu and reducing the fat content in their milk (Kelly, Debra). At the same time, they began to market these healthy options in order to influence the public’s perception of how healthy they were. One study in the UK, which looked at the influence of McDonald’s Happy Meal advertisements on children’s food choices, found that although the food depicted in the advertisements showed healthier options, children would often not choose these healthy options. Thus, they concluded that “this kind of food promotion, which is permitted on television… seemingly does not drive healthier food choices, but simply promotes a liking for fast food more generally.” (Boyland, Emma J., et al).</p>

								<p class="mb-4">While brands like McDonald’s were trying to change their image to appeal to the public, other brands, such as Subway, took advantage of the public’s preference for healthier fast food. In 1997, they began to advertise how their low-fat sandwiches matched up with other brand’s offerings. Soon after, in 2000, they created ads with Jared Fogle, a man who claimed to have lost over 200 pounds by eating primarily Subway. They grew in popularity and number, and by 2002 had more locations open than even McDonald’s. (Olito, Frank). And, thanks to these campaigns, they gained the public image of a healthy fast food option.</p>

								<p class="mb-4">Although they had an image of health, an image McDonald’s was striving for, it wasn’t completely accurate. One study looked at adolescent purchasing behavior at McDonald’s and compared it with their behavior at Subway in order to see if the food they purchased was actually much healthier. The results showed that the participants purchased more carbs and sugars at McDonald’s, but more sodium at Subway. Subway’s meals did have more vegetables, but the study cautions, “although Subway may be ‘healthier,’ it still may not be healthy.” In the end, the researchers concluded that “despite the perceived public opinion that Subway is the healthy fast food restaurant,” their participants consumed a similar number of calories and a similar amount of saturated fat at both Subway and McDonald’s. Thus, they believed that Subway is not really a healthier option (Lesser, Lenard I., et al). Importantly, the consumers themselves don’t always realize the number of calories they are consuming. Another study, which looked at calorie estimations for meals from Subway and meals from McDonald’s, found that “consumers estimate the familiar sandwiches and burgers contain up to 35% fewer calories when they come from restaurants claiming to be healthy, such as Subway, than when they come from restaurants not making this claim, such as McDonald’s”. Another important detail to add is that they also found that when consumers believe the main dish is “healthy,” they often choose side dishes that also contain a high number of calories (Chandon, Pierre, and Brian Wansink).</p>
