								<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
                                    What changed consumer’s perceptions of fast food? When did that change happen?
                                </p>

								<p class="mb-4">Eventually, after years of increased portion sizes and with it, increased obesity, Americans started to catch on that fast food wasn’t the healthiest option. Starting in the 1990s and 2000s, fast food companies began to feel pressures to give healthier options and to reduce their portion sizes. McDonald’s even began a “Eat Smart, Be Active” initiative in 2003, and eventually announced they would eliminate their super size option in 2004, but they still received unwanted attention as the documentary <span style="font-style: italic">Super Size Me</span> also came out in 2004 (Kelly, Debra; Spurlock, Morgan). However, McDonald’s has claimed that their decision to remove super sized items from their menu was due to menu simplification, and not related to the <span style="font-style: italic">Super Size Me</span> documentary (Kelly, Debra). According to one study, this documentary did, at least in the short term, increase many factors of young adults that should help them make smarter eating decisions (Cottone, Ellen, and Carol Byrd-Bredbenner). Thus, with <span style="font-style: italic">Super Size Me</span> came some greater public awareness of the potentially negative impacts of fast food.</p>

								<p class="mb-4">Yet, despite this awareness, not much changed. According to a study which looked at the nutritional value of fast food options from 1986 to 2016, there was a significant increase in portion sizes, sodium, and calories in entrees, sides, and desserts at fast food restaurants (McCrory, Megan A., et al). Starting in 2008, different states and localities created laws requiring nutritional information such as caloric content to be posted in chain restaurants. One study about the impact of these laws found that in restaurants in locations with these laws, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of healthier adult entrees over restaurants outside of these areas. However, no such improvement was found for child entrees, and the average nutritional value in adult entrees and sides remained unchanged (Namba, Alexa, et al). Therefore, fast food brands really made no significant change in the nutritional quality of their food after facing pressure to do so. Instead, they changed how they marketed themselves to consumers.</p>
